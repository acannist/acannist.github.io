  <h2>Leadership</h2>
  <p>I have strong leadership skills from co-founding and leading the Tampa Bay chapter of Girl Develop It. In the four years that I ran it, I grew the local non-profit community organization to 1,000 members with 4-6 active development classes happening monthly, along with a very active Slack community.</p>
  <p>As a team lead, I have run several departments, both creative and frontend, and help them work as a cohesive team. I've successfully implemented new processes, organized summits for clients, and improved the relationships across departments. I have a proven track record of clear communication skills and creative problem-solving. As a leader I have taken full responsibility for the work of my team.</p>
